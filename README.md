# Communication Simulator
 Simulation of real time incoming calls, based on the acceptable Erlang-B blocking factor.
 The application calculates the SIRN, position from the base station, signal's power for each incoming call.
 Regarding input, the script needs: the available channels, call duration, interarrival time
 Calls are created by Poisson distribution, based on the interarrival time
